# email_spam
Nearly every email user has at some point encountered a "spam" email, which is an unsolicited message often advertising a product, containing links to malware, or attempting to scam the recipient. Roughly 80-90% of more than 100 billion emails sent each day are spam emails, most being sent from botnets of malware-infected computers. The remainder of emails are called "ham" emails.

As a result of the huge number of spam emails being sent across the Internet each day, most email providers offer a spam filter that automatically flags likely spam messages and separates them from the ham. Though these filters use a number of techniques (e.g. looking up the sender in a so-called "Blackhole List" that contains IP addresses of likely spammers), most rely heavily on the analysis of the contents of an email via text analytics.

In this project  a spam filter was built  using a publicly available dataset first described in the 2006 conference paper "Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes â€” Which Naive Bayes?" by V. Metsis, I. Androutsopoulos, and G. Paliouras.
